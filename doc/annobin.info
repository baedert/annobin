Annotating Binaries: How Was Your Program Built ?
*************************************************

This manual describes the ANNOBIN plugin, and how you can use it to
determine what security features were used when building your binary.

   This manual is for 'annobin' (Annobin) version 3.1.

1 What is Binary Annotation ?
*****************************

Binary Annotation is a method for recording information about an
application inside the application itself.  It is an implementation of
the 'Watermark' specification defined here:
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Toolchain/Watermark>

   Although mainly focused on recording security information, the system
can be used to record any kind of data, even data not related to the
application.  One of the main goals of the system however is the ability
to specify the address range over which a given piece of information is
valid.  So for example it is possible to specify that all of a program
was compiled with the '-O2' option except for one special function which
was compiled with '-O0' instead.

   The range information is useful because it allows third parties to
examine the binary and find out if its construction was consistent.  Ie
that there are no gaps in the recorded information, and no special cases
where a required feature was not active.

   The system works by adding a special section to the application
containing individual pieces of information along with an address range
for which the information is valid.  (Some effort has gone into the
storing this information in a reasonably compact format).

   The information is generated by a plugin that is attached to the
'gcc' compiler.  (This is just one method for generating the
information.  Any interested party can create and add information to the
binary, providing that they follow the Watermark specification).  This
plugin is called 'annobin'.  It uses information obtained from the
compiler to record details such as the ABI variant in use and the
hardening options applied.

   The information can be extracted from files via the use of tools like
'readelf'.  The 'annobin' package includes a set of sample scripts that
use 'readelf' in this way to check various features of an application,
such as its conformation to the hardening requirements, or possible ABI
violations.

2 How to add Binary Annotations to your application.
****************************************************

Normally the option to enable the recording of binary annotation notes
is enabled automatically by the build system, so no user intervention is
required.  On Fedora and RHEL based systems this is handled by the
'redhat-rpm-config' package.

   If necessary however the binary annotation plugin can be specifically
added to the gcc command line by adding the '-fplugin=annobin' option.
It may also be necessary to tell gcc where to find plugins by adding the
'-iplugindir=' option, although this should only be necessary if the
plugin is installed in a separate place from 'gcc'.

   If it is desired to disable the recording of binary annotations then
the '-fplugin-arg-annobin-disable' can be used, although this must be
placed _after_ the '-fplugin=annobin' option.

   On Fedora and RHEL systems the plugin can be disabled entirely for
all compilations in a package by adding '%undefine _annotated_build' to
the spec file.

   The plugin also accepts a small selection of command line arguments,
all accessed by passing '-fplugin-arg-annobin-<option>' on the gcc
command line.  These options must be placed on the gcc command line
after the plugin itself is mentioned.  The options are:

'disable'
'enable'
     Either disable or enable the plugin.  The default is for the plugin
     to be enabled.

'help'
     Display a list of supported options on the standard output.  This
     is in addition to whatever else the plugin has been instructed to
     do.

'version'
     Display the version of the plugin on the standard output.  This is
     in addition to whatever else the plugin has been instructed to do.

'verbose'
     Report the actions that the plugin is taking.  If invoked for a
     second time on the command line the plugin will be very verbose.

'no-dynamic-notes'
'dynamic-notes'
     Do not, or do, record information for the dynamic loader.  The
     default is to record this information.

'no-static-notes'
'static-notes'
     Do not, or do, record information for static analysis.  The default
     is to record this information.

'stack-size-notes'
'no-stack-size-notes'
     Do, or do not, record information about the stack requirements of
     functions in the executable.  This feature is disabled by default
     as these notes can take up a lot of extra room if the executable
     contains a lot of functions.

'stack-threshold=N'
     If stack size requirements are being recorded then this option sets
     the minimum value to record.  Functions which require less than 'N'
     bytes of static stack space will not have their requirements
     recorded.  If not set, then 'N' defaults to 1024.

3 How to examine the Binary Annotations stored in an application.
*****************************************************************

The information is stored in the ELF Note format in a special section
called '.gnu.build.attributes'.  The 'readelf' program from the
'binutils' package can extract and display these notes when the
'--notes' option is provided.  (Adding the '--wide' option is also
helpful).  Here is an example of the output:

     Displaying notes found in: .gnu.build.attributes
       Owner                        Data size	Description
       GA$<version>3p3              0x00000010	OPEN	    Applies to region from 0x8a0 to 0x8c6 (hello.c)
       GA$<tool>gcc 7.2.1 20170915  0x00000000	OPEN	    Applies to region from 0x8a0 to 0x8c6
       GA*GOW:0x452b                0x00000000	OPEN	    Applies to region from 0x8a0 to 0x8c6
       GA*<stack prot>strong        0x00000000	OPEN	    Applies to region from 0x8a0 to 0x8c6
       GA*GOW:0x412b                0x00000010	func	    Applies to region from 0x8c0 to 0x8c6 (baz)

   This shows various different pieces of information, including the
fact that the notes were produced using version 3 of the specification,
and version 3 of the plugin.  The binary was built by gcc version 7.2.1
and the -fstack-protector-strong option was enabled on the command line.
The program was compiled with -O2 enabled except the baz() function
which was compiled with -O0 instead.

   The most complicated part of the notes is the owner field.  This is
used to encode the type of note as well as its value and possibly extra
data as well.  The format of the field is explained in detail in the
Watermark specification, but it basically consists of the letters 'G'
and 'A' followed by an encoding character (one of '*$!+') and then a
type character and finally the value.

   Most of the notes have a reasonably self explanatory name and value.
The exception are the 'version' and 'GOW' notes, which are explained
below.

* Menu:

* The Version Encoding::  Encoding Versions
* The GOW Encoding::      Encoding Optimization and Debugging Levels

   The 'annobin' package includes some example scripts that demonstrate
how the binary information can be used.  The scripts are:

'built-by.sh'
     Reports the name and version of the tool used to build the
     specified file(s).  This script also demonstrates how information
     can be extracted from other other locations in the file, not just
     the binary annotation notes.

     The script can also be used to filter files, only reporting those
     built by a specific tool, or a specific version of a tool, or even
     by a version of a tool that was built between a range of dates.

'check-abi.sh'
     Reports any potential ABI conflicts in the files specified.  This
     includes the use of the '-fshort-enums' option, the
     '-fstack-protector' option and the '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE' option.  All
     of these can affect passing data between functions and hence should
     be used uniformly throughout the binary.

'hardened.sh'
     Reports on the hardening status of the specified file(s).  In
     particular it checks that the whole file was compiled with '-O2' or
     higher and the '-fstack-protector-strong', '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2',
     '-Wl,-z,now', '-Wl,-z,relro', '-fPIE', '-Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS'
     and '-fstack-clash-protection' options.

3.1 Encoding Protocol and Producer Versions
===========================================

The 'version' note encodes the version of the Watermark specification
used and the version of the tool used to generate the notes.  Typically
these will both be 3.


File: annobin.info,  Node: The GOW Encoding,  Prev: The Version Encoding,  Up: Checking

3.2 Encoding Optimization and Debugging Levels
==============================================

The 'GOW' note encodes the optimization level ('-O') and debugging level
('-g') used when compiling a binary.  In order to save space this is
stored as a bit field with the bits having the following meanings:

'bits 0 - 2'
     The debug type, ie DBX, DWARF, VMS or XCOFF. As specified by the
     '-gstabs', '-gdwarf', '-gvms' and '-gxcoff' options.

'bit 3'
     Set if GNU extensions to the debug type have been enabled.

'bits 4 - 5'
     The debug info level ie TERSE, NORMAL or VERBOSE as set by the
     '-g<level>' option.

'bits 6 - 8'
     The DWARF version, if DWARF is being generated.  Set by the
     '-gdwarf-<version>' option.

'bits 9 - 10'
     The optimization level as set by the '-O<number>' option.  Levels
     above 3 are treated as if they were 3.

'bit 11'
     Set if the optimize-for-size option ('-Os') is enabled.

'bit 12'
     Set if the inaccurate-but-fast optimization option ('-Ofast') has
     been enabled.

'bit 13'
     Set if the optimize-with-debugging option ('-Og') has been enabled.

'bit 14'
     Set if the enable most warnings option ('-Wall') has been enabled.

   The other bits are not currently used and should be set to zero so
they can be used in future extensions to the specification.

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
