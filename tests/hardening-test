# The --skip=... options are here to skip the checks that require a version
# 2.30 (or later) readelf, and which were generated by a plugin attached to
# a version 8 (or later) gcc.  Since neither of these versions of the tools
# are in common use (yet) the checks are disabled.
# The other hardening properties can be deduced by the hardened.sh script
# without needing the notes produced by annobin, so that is why the test is
# allowed to proceed.
# FIXME: Remove the --skip= options once readelf and gcc have been updated.
#
# The --skip-pic and --skip-stack options are here because /usr/lib64/libc_nonshared.a(elf-init.oS)
# is built with -fPIC and -fno-stack-protection.  /usr/lib64/Scrti.o is built
# with -fpie which makes the pic test impossible.
