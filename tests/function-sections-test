# Note - currently unused_func_1 and unused_func_2 will not be
# garbage collected.  The duplicate of the linkonce_func_1
# function however will be discarded.  This is because the linker
# sees the relocations in the gnu build notes section against
# the unused functions, and since they are not in a section
# group together, it presumes that the relocations must be
# satisified.
#
# To solve this problem the annobin plugin will have to create
# a section group containing both the code and the notes.  In
# fact strictly speaking GCC should be doing this, and annobin
# should just be adding the notes to the section group.


# FIXME - we should check that the notes were parsed correctly...
# FIXME - we should check for gaps.
